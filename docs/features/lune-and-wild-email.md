Hi [name],

As promised, three options below. If you only read one, read the hybrid.

You get the full 8-area audit in month 1 (the part that actually determines what gets built), then drop to the lighter retainer for execution. £8,470 over 6 months instead of £17,970 for growth. Same depth where it counts, half the cost.

Visual overview here: [happypages.co/proposals/lune-and-wild/](https://happypages.co/proposals/lune-and-wild/)

All prices include our founder's discount, locked in for early partners.

**Growth partner — ~~£5,995~~ £2,995/month**

Month 1 is a full CRO audit across 8 areas: homepage, guided shopping flow, PDP to checkout, subscription landing, post-purchase, GA4 funnel analysis, competitor benchmarking, and personalisation strategy (Octane/Klaviyo). We review 20–30 session recordings, tear down 3–4 competitors, and deliver a 30–45 min video walkthrough of every finding.

Months 2–6: 4–6 deliverables per month, weekly async updates, quarterly roadmap re-prioritisation, before/after measurement on every change. £17,970 over 6 months.

**Hybrid — ~~£5,995~~ £2,995 month 1, then ~~£1,995~~ £1,095/month**

Month 1 is identical to growth. Same audit, same deliverables.

The difference is months 2–6: 2–3 deliverables per month instead of 4–6, board-based comms instead of weekly updates, no quarterly re-prioritisation. You keep the roadmap and the build work, you lose the ongoing strategy loop.

£8,470 over 6 months. £9,500 less than growth.

---

**Build retainer — ~~£1,995~~ £1,095/month**

Month 1: conversion audit across 5 flows (homepage, guided shopping, PDP to checkout, subscription landing, post-purchase). Annotated findings, prioritised build queue. Months 2–6: 2–3 deliverables per month, board-based comms.

Doesn't include data analysis, competitors, or the video walkthrough. £6,570 over 6 months.

If hybrid sounds right, reply "hybrid" and I'll send the agreement. Or just reply and we'll find a time to talk it through.

Founder's pricing locked in for engagements starting by April 2026.
