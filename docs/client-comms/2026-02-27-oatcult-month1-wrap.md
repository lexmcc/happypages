Hi guys,

Month 1 is wrapping up, brief overview and outlook for you.

**What we shipped**

Research: PDP benchmarking across 15+ subscription brands, CRO audit across the core flows, web brand system.

On-site: redesigned the shop page with a clear adding flow, mobile sticky CTA, subscription savings pill, subscribe and save card always on, home page call to action, hero gallery improvement, and copy improvements.

**Where we are**

As we've been discussing, the hybrid shopping flow isn't landing. The size cards look interactive when they're not, and it's creating friction. We wouldn't know that without having built and tested it though, and the research backs up exactly where the problem is and what to replace it with.

**Month 2**

Full shop page redesign, pulling together the month 1 research and what we've learned since. Better social proof, stronger narrative structure, more intuitive buying flow.

Alongside that:
- Deeper funnel analytics
- Offer structure and how it's presented on-site
- Reviews app integration

Want me to get month 2 going?

Alex
